 so in order to make an explanation on how this FORD HOHNSON SORT WORKS :
    let's start with the argument, the argument is a list of unsigned ints so if one of the 
		numbers given is negative we should throw an error.
    once we got the full list of the numbers, the first step will be to check the length.
        if the lenght % 2 == 1, the we need to remove one element and save in till later.
        else we will move to the second step directly .
    the second step will be to divide our list of numbers into pairs of two numbers, then sort 
		each two separately.
    once it's sorted we will seprate the smallest of each pair in a small list and the biggest 
		of each pair in a big numbers list.
    the third step will be to sort one of the two lists and insert the unsorted one 
		to the sorted one.
    and last insert the remaining number if it exists.

    we need to be able to use this process for two types of containers in order to check 
		the difference in time complexity between the two.




    let's start by spliting the array into pairs first and sort them.

    3 234 | 9 876 |  9998 23423 | 4 8

    a = 234 | 876 | 23423 | 8 . (Main chain)*
    b =  3  |  9  |  9998 | 4 . (Pend elements)*

  Jacobsthal numbers are a sequence of integers named after the Czech mathematician Ernst Jacobsthal.
    The sequence is defined recursively as follows:
  In other words, the first two Jacobsthal numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the
   sum of the previous two multiplied by 2.

The Jacobsthal sequence begins:
   0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, and so on.  
so the formula is :
